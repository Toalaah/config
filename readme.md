## Config ‚öôÔ∏è

### Dependencies

It is *recommended* to update brew before actually begining with the installation. This can be done with the following command:

```shell
brew update
```

Install **git** with (this is required!):

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

### Installation

1. Clone into the repository with the following command and navigate into the directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/toalaah/config
cd config
```

2. Run the setup script from the directory

```shell
./setup
```

3. Profit üëç

### Other Optional Steps

Some programs that I will install on the side include, but are not limited to:

- Visual Studio Code
- Skim (really nice pdf-viewer for auto-rendering latex pdfs on vim writes)
- Alfred, just plain better than spotlight
