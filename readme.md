## Config ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites
It is recommended to update brew before actually begining with the installation. This can be done with the following command:

```shell
brew update
```

Aditionally now would also be the time to install zsh and set it as your default shell:

```shell
brew install zsh
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

### Installation
1. Clone into the repository with the following command and navigate into the directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/toalaah/config
cd config
```

2. Run the setup script from **within** the directory

```shell
./setup.sh
```

3. Profit üëç

### Other Optional Steps

Some programs that I will install on the side include, but are not limited to:

- Visual Studio Code
- Skim (really nice pdf-viewer for auto-rendering latex pdfs on vim writes)
- Alfred, just plain better than spotlight
