## Config üöÄ

### Prerequisites
You should have the following programs / packages already preinstalled, using brew or other standard installation methods:

- Nvim (Neovim)
- Tmux

- Zsh (preferred shell of mine) 

### Installation
1. Clone into the repository with the following command and navigate into the directory

git clone https://github.com/toalaah/config
cd config
```

2. Run the following command from **within** the directory

./setup.sh
```

3. Profit üëç

### Other Optional Steps

Some programs that I will install on the side include, but are not limited to:

- Visual Studio Code
- Typora, for writing and viewing markdown files
- Skim (really nice pdf-viewer for auto-rendering latex pdfs on vim writes)
- Alfred, just plain better than spotlight
