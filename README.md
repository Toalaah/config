# Dotfiles, Configs, & Co

## Installation

### Note

There is an alternative setup script ``new_install.sh`` for which the installation process is identical. However this script install additional applications which I normally install immediately upon reformatting my system, for example iTerm or Google Chrome.
Currently this is only configured to work with macOS, however the process below is system-independent.

1. Clone into the repository with the following command
```shell
git clone https://github.com/toalaah/config
```

2. Run the following command from within the directory
```shell
./setup.sh
```

3. ?

4. Profit
